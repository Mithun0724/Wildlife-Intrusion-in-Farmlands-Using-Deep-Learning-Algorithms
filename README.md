# Wildlife-Intrusion-in-Farmlands-Using-Deep-Learning-Algorithms
This project detects wild animal intrusions in farmlands using YOLOv8 and OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi. When an animal is detected, it sends an alert via LoRa through an Arduino Uno and emails the detection image to the farmer, enabling timely action to prevent crop damage.
